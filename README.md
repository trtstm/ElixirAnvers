# Anvers

Anvers will be a blogging engine written in Elixir using the Phoenix framework.

Note that I am writing this to learn Elixir, so it will probably contain poorly written code :).

To start:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
